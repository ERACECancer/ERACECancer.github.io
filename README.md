=====================
ERACE Cancer is a group of students and researchers working to Establish Race and Class Equality in Cancer. We lead educational initiatives that disseminate information on cancer prevention strategies to the Stanford campus community and at-risk populations in the Bay Area. In addition to outreach efforts, we serve as a forum for discussions on the social determinants of health and the societal factors that shape access to adequate healthcare.
