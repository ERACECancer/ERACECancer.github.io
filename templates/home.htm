            <h2>Cancer Prevention</h2>
            <p> Over 30% of cancer deaths are due to five behavioral and dietary risks: high body mass index (BMI), low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use. Tobacco alone is estimated to be the leading cause of over 20% of global cancer deaths and about 70% of global lung cancer deaths. Other environmental factors that are strongly correlated with cancer incidence are... </p>

            <p class="lead">For the third consecutive year, Stanford Health Care's Ear Nose and Throat Clinic will offer a free screening for oral cancer.  Every year in the United States, over 40,000 people are diagnosed with oral cancer.  Oral Cancer has a notoriously low survival rate because the disease is often not caught until it has spread to other sites in the body, making it more difficult to treat.  The screening is happening on October 4th, from 8am to noon at 801 Welch on the Stanford Campus. For more information or to register for the screening, please call: (650) 308-9990 or email oralhealth@eracecancer.org</p>

            <p class="lead">There are many ways to contribute to ongoing efforts to expand access to adequate health care and disseminate educational information on cancer screening and prevention.  The general member meetings of ERACE Cancer happen weekly, thursday evenings at 5PM in LKSC.  We also recommend considering participation in the Stanford Free Clinic programs.  If you are interested in conducting clinical research on cancer outcomes, we are currently interviewing for Fall 2014 Research Fellows. Email info@eracecancer.org with any questions</p>
