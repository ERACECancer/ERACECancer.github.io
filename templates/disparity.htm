                <p class="lead">Cancer and Health Disparities: Lifting the Veil </p>

                <p>The fight against cancer has undoubtedly been one of the most driven and public movements in the last decade. From marathon running to private gala events, fundraising for a “cancer cure” has become habitual for many Americans.  With a total of revenue of $925 million for 2012, the American Cancer Society has a 93% dependence on donor contributions. This amounts to a total of $889 million—a figure that dwarves the mere $8 million received by the US government.   Behind Americans’ monetary disposition toward cancer charity lies a public fervor that narrates the most commonly told story behind cancer—cancer is an inconspicuous killer that can target anyone at any time.  To an extent, the public anxiety surrounding cancer is justified—cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States and approximately 585,720 people in the United States alone are projected to die in 2014. </p>
                <p>Undoubtedly, funds from donors have been critical to advances in cancer research and will continue to be the main sources of revenue for many cancer organizations and foundations. But what do we lose in the commercialization of cancer? What about cancer slips through the cracks when we donate that extra buck or run a 5k for the cause? With the millions upon millions of donations raised, the discrepancies surround who gets cancer and dies from it most often is blurred under the pervasive notion of cancer as an unbiased killer. </p>
                <p>The factors contributing to cancer diagnosis are undoubtedly complex but what we seem to hone in on are the preventable strategies that are seemingly within our control. From exercise to a balanced diet, we are constantly informed about that extra potent vegetable or the á la mode superfood with anticarcinogenic properties. Our individualistic (and very characteristically, American) attitudes predict cancer to be distributed evenly across the United States. In reality, cancer is one of the most unevenly distributed diseases.  What we see in cancer is the presence of health disparities. A population is defined to have a health disparity “if there is a significant disparity in the overall rate of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality or survival rates in the population as compared to the health status of the general population.” According to the CDC, heath disparities are directly related to unequal distribution of resources in populations. The question becomes: what are these populations and how do these recourse allocations play into cancer? </p>
                <p>When it comes to cancer prevention (or preventative measures in general) access is key. Access to healthy foods, health insurance, medical practitioners, etc., is fractioned along socioeconomic and racial lines. Socioeconomic status (SES) is based on a combination of factors including social status, income, education level, and occupation. SES not only predicts an individual’s access to education, work conditions, and health care but also plays a strong role in the prevalence of behavioral risks—all associated with the risk of developing and surviving cancer. </p>
                <p>So what are the biggest factors contributing to these cancer health disparities? Forget the Big Mac or the extra hour on the couch—socioeconomic status and access to health care followed by race/ethnic background are the most important factors contributing to cancer. A closer look into cancer statistics reveals the horrifying plot twist to this tale.  For example, though white women have the highest rate of breast cancer diagnosis, African-American women are more likely to die of the disease. Latina women are disproportionately affected with high rates of cervical cancer and American Indians/Native Alaskans have the highest rates of kidney cancer than any other group. We find disparities in lung, prostate, oral, and colorectal cancer. The list goes on and so do the amount of deaths.</p>
                <p>The pervasive narrative of the unbiased killer is busted and we are left with a different picture of cancer. The story of cancer is not one of random chance but rather a sad reminder of historical and current unequal distribution of recourses that have led to these disparities. If we are truly aiming to find a “cure for cancer,” broader social issues must be addressed as root problems. Americans might have been created equal but tell us we certainly aren’t equal—a truer thing could not be said when it comes to cancer.
